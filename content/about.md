Hello, my name is Calen Robinette and I am currently a graduate student studying
computer science in Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) program.
Prior to this, I attended Portland State University studying mathematics with a
focus on Topology. You can contact me via [email](mailto:calen.robinette@gatech.edu)
and can find my updated resume [here](resume.pdf).

Besides computers and math, I've spent a good portion of my life dedicated to
studying coffee and food. I have [competed as a
barista](https://uscoffeechampionships.org/), helped organize [coffee community
events](https://bostontnt.wordpress.com/), and generally enjoy learning and
talking about coffee. Currently I enjoy cooking at home, but in the past I was
lucky to be able to intern at [108](https://108.dk/en/homepage-splash/) and
[Noma](https://noma.dk/), as well as run my own pop-up restaurant
[Margo](https://www.instagram.com/margo.pdx/).
